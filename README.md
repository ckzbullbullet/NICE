# NICE-Dataset
NICE-Dataset is a vision-language dataset for image commenting. Given an image, models are required to generate human-like comments grounded on the image. NICE-Dataset has two settings. You can download images and related data for each setting at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V6M1W8x9vCKgabE-1dCfpoHMnj0TM00z?usp=sharing).

There are three folders in the link: images, Setting1, and Setting2.
